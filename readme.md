I have kept the game jam theme (Urban) and used the idea of a small-town city-building game. Inspired by Sim City and Kings Is Me, I tried to explore this kind of experience, where you need to keep to create a city but in a small and cute way, instead of big cities (as in common city building games).

This was a 48h project for Admix Spring Game (https://itch.io/jam/admix-spring-game-jam), so most of the code does not has good refactoring or tests.
